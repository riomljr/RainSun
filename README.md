Creating a weather app using a free weather API.
Live @ https://riomljr.github.io/RainSun/

This is an exercise from the Odin Project to demonstrate how I work with APIs. Using Fetch and a free weather API https://www.weatherapi.com.

In this project I demonstrate my ability to use Async functions as well as the Fetch API to retrieve data. I used a modular approach to bulding this app and tried to refrain from using CSS frameworks to keep it light and as simple as I could.
